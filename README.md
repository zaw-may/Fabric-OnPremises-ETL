### Existing Environment
* Currently, the companyâ€™s core data resides in an on-premises SQL Server environment. The SQL database contains multiple schemas and a large number of tables.
* The SQL database will also integrate with external systems, including third-party applications, file systems and, occasionally, APIs.
* In the future, the data is expected to grow beyond its current size.
* For cost-effectiveness, they want to use incremental data loading for large tables.
* During data ingestion, only lightweight data transformations are required. However, more complex transformations may be needed in the future.
* The client organization wants to process the data on a schedule and incremental refresh.
* They are also considering implementing the Medallion Architecture to improve data quality and consistency.
