### Objective 
Transition from On-premises SQL Database to Microsoft Fabric SQL Database for enhanced analytics.

### Technologies
Microsoft Fabric Analytics, Data Pipeline, On-premises Data Gateway, SQL Server 2022, Fabric SQL Database

### Data Pipeline

### Scenario
* Currently, the companyâ€™s core data resides in an on-premises SQL Server environment. The SQL database contains multiple schemas and a large number of tables.
* The SQL database will also integrate with external systems, including third-party applications, file systems and, occasionally, APIs.
* In the future, the data is expected to grow beyond its current size.
* For cost-effectiveness, they want to use incremental data loading for large tables.
* During data ingestion, only lightweight data transformations are required. However, more complex transformations may be needed in the future.
* The client organization wants to process the data on a schedule and incremental refresh.
* They are also considering implementing the Medallion Architecture to improve data quality and consistency.

### Prerequisite
* SQL Server (including database tables you want to work with)
* Fabric SQL Database (including already-created stored procedures - you need to change them based on your requirements)
* On-premises data gateway (including a specific connection with your SQL Server)
